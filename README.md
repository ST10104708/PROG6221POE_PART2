Changes Made in Response to Lecturer Feedback:
In response to the lecturer's input on Part 1, I made the following adjustments to the application:


1. The code has been modified to allow the user to enter an unlimited number of recipes.
 This was accomplished by storing and managing the recipes in a generic collection (ListRecipe>).

2. A new feature has been added that allows the user to name each recipe. 
This allows for more personalized and descriptive recipe identification.

3. The presentation of a list of all the recipes in alphabetical order by name has been implemented.
 This makes it easier for the user to navigate the list and select a certain recipe.

4. The ingredient entry feature has been enhanced to incorporate the number of calories and the food group to which each ingredient belongs.
 This extra information provides a complete summary of the nutritional elements of the recipe.

5. The total calories for each recipe were calculated and displayed. 
This allows the user to keep track of the calorie content of their dishes and make more educated choices.

6. A notice function has been added that warns the user when the total calories in a recipe exceed 300.
 This raises awareness of high-calorie meals and encourages healthy cooking habits.

These enhancements enhance the recipe management application's overall functionality and user experience. 
Users may now maintain an unlimited number of recipes, conveniently identify and
 pick recipes, track nutritional information, and receive high-calorie recipe notifications.
